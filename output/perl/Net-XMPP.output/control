Description: XMPP Support Library
 Net::XMPP is a convenient tool to use for any perl script that would like to
 utilize the XMPP Instant Messaging protocol. While not a client in and of
 itself, it provides all of the necessary back-end functions to make a CGI
 client or command-line perl client feasible and easy to use. Net::XMPP is a
 wrapper around the rest of the official Net::XMPP::xxxxxx packages.
 .
 There is are example scripts in the example directory that provide you with
 examples of very simple XMPP programs.
 .
 NOTE: The parser that XML::Stream::Parser provides, as are most Perl parsers,
 is synchronous. If you are in the middle of parsing a packet and call a user
 defined callback, the Parser is blocked until your callback finishes. This
 means you cannot be operating on a packet, send out another packet and wait
 for a response to that packet. It will never get to you. Threading might
 solve this, but as of this writing threading in Perl is not quite up to par
 yet. This issue will be revisted in the future.
