Description: Perl client interface to SSH
 Net::SSH::Perl is an all-Perl module implementing an SSH (Secure Shell)
 client. It is compatible with both the SSH-1 and SSH-2 protocols.
 .
 Net::SSH::Perl enables you to simply and securely execute commands on remote
 machines, and receive the STDOUT, STDERR, and exit status of that remote
 command. It contains built-in support for various methods of authenticating
 with the server (password authentication, RSA challenge-response
 authentication, etc.). It completely implements the I/O buffering, packet
 transport, and user authentication layers of the SSH protocol, and makes use
 of external Perl libraries (in the Crypt:: family of modules) to handle
 encryption of all data sent across the insecure network. It can also read
 your existing SSH configuration files (/etc/ssh_config, etc.), RSA identity
 files, DSA identity files, known hosts files, etc.
 .
 This description was automagically extracted from the module by dh-make-perl.
